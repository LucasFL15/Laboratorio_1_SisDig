Peak Memory Usage:  729 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  9 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   7 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc3s700an' is a WebPack part.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network reset_IBUF has no load.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:159 - Net Timing constraints on signal clk are pushed forward
   through input buffer.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
